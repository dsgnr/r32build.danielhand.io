I'd been battling for some time to fix an annoying oil level sensor warning when the car starts. A while back, I replaced checked all the wiring and swapped out the bonnet microswitch. Unfortunately, this didn't solve the issue, so it was time to change the sensor. I drained the oil out and swapped the sensor over. Not a difficult job, just a pain to drain the oil. I put in new oil and a new oil filter whilst I was here. The issue seems to have resolved itself. For now...
