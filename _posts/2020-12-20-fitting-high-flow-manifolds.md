I managed to get some time today to fit the Lucifer high flow manifolds. These went on pretty easily, just a little fiddly when you're on your own! More pictures to come when it stops raining! I also renewed the following parts whilst I was here:

- Intake manifold gasket
- Intake manifold grommets 
- Throttle body gasket
- Exhaust manifold gaskets
- Exhaust manifold studs and nuts
- Various intake manifold bolts
