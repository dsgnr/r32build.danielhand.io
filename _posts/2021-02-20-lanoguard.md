post_description: Rust protection with Lanoguard 
author: dan_hand

One of the main annoyances I had with removing everything off the car was the rusty bolts. I wanted to protect everything so hopefully, if I have to work on the car in the future, I will have an easier time.

I did a lot of research of various different rust prevention brands, and Lanoguard seemed to come up quite a few times on YouTube. I opted to give the Moto spray a go.

I sprayed the complete under side of the car, wheel arches, all the powder coated elements and the brake lines (the originals were seized solid and snapped when I tried to undo them), literally everything was sprayed. I probably went over the top here.

Spraying Lanoguard on was super simple and I did the whole car in around 20 minutes and let it dry over night.

The powder coat isn't really a glossy black anymore - more like a grey satin colour which is unfortunate, but I don't think it looks all that terrible. At the end of the day, you’re not going to see it when the wheels are on!

I didn’t get any pictures of the wheel arches before I put the liners back in (I also sprayed the liners with Lanoguard for extra rust protection… on plastic).

Excuse the bin liner in the images - I’ve been using it to protect the brake discs during the rain.

I was not sponsored by Lanoguard for this and I paid for the item and did my own research in to the product. However, if they see this and would like to reimburse for the purchase, then please reach out!
