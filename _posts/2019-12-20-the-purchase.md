I traded my MK5 R32 with 102k miles in for a MK4 R32. Why? My first car was a MK4 1.8T GTI and I had always wanted to purchase a MK4 R32. At the time, the MK4 R32's were just way out of my budget, so I settled for a MK5 R32. The car was very refined, but a little too refined. I could push the car as hard as I wanted, and it wouldn't blink an eye.

I was on the hunt for a little while for a low-ish milage MK4 R32 and I finally found one!

Enter the 85k mile 2003 R32. The car is completely standard except for the Miltek resonated cat-back exhaust system.

After getting it home, I reviewed the car in more detail and there were a few things I wanted to address:
   - The steering felt a little sloppy
   - Passenger side roof sill was showing some signs of rust
   - Stereo was poor
   - Wheels were in decent condition, but could do with a refurb
   - The rear callipers weren't genuine VW, and weren't great
   - The handbrake was very poor
   - The front bumper grills were faded
   - The steering wheel was showing its age
