One upgrade I'd been wanting to do for some time was to upgrade the engine mounts. The current ones are the originals from the factory, and whilst there isn't a huge amount of engine rock, I have noticed that after driving for some time, the downpipes look to be catching on a heat shield when going over bumps etc. I installed both Vibra-Technics engine (VAG404M), gearbox mounts (VAG606M), as well as their dogbone large bush and inserts (VAG450M). All in their 'road' configuration.

The engine doesn't have nearly as much added NVH as I was expecting - in fact, some sections of the rev range, there is decreased vibrations! The upgrade, in my opinion, is very subtle. There is a few new noises on start-up which I'd not heard before - notably, the starter is louder and I can hear the flywheel spooling more. Normal gear shifts feel slightly smoother despite coming from a full poly bushed dogbone mount, but it certainly is extremely subtle. Cornering does feel nicer and I can definitely feel what others mean about the engine being more connected.

Overall, I don't have a bad thing to say about these mounts other than I was expecting a night and day difference over my original mounts.
