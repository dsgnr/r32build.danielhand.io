I left the car for almost two months to let the new paint gas off.

Even though the car had been sat on the drive all this time, I went through and decontaminated the paint with a Bilt Hamber clay bar and TFR.

Washed using the two bucket method and then polished using a Das 6 Pro+ v2 and Menzerna 3800 and a black finishing pad.

I wasn't sure how hard the clear coat would be, so I didn't want to go agressive at all.
