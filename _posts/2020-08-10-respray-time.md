post_description: Getting the MK4 R32 resprayed 
author: dan_hand

The car had a little amount of rust forming on the roof sill, so I wanted to get this sorted out as soon as possible.

It was more cost effective to get the whole car resprayed!

When taking the front wings off the car, there were significant amounts of rust on the inner side due to the sound deadening that is placed there from factory. New front wings were required.

New roof gutter seals were purchased from VW as well.
