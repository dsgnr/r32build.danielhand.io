I always heard great things about moving to a short shifter. I opted for the Forge as I have a bit of a soft spot for them, and their customer service/support is great. I put it on the shortest setting. It feels great, but I'm not sure it's as night and day as everyone makes out. Maybe if I add the side-to-side kit, it'd make a bigger difference...
