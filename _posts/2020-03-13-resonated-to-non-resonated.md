I didn't like how quiet the resonated Miltek was on the MK4 compared to the MK5 - the MK5 R32 was loud and the MK4 is too silent.

Managed to pick up a Lucifer non-resonated centre section for not too much money so swapped these out.

Had to replace the exhaust clamps since they were rusted badly and sheared when I tried to remove it.
