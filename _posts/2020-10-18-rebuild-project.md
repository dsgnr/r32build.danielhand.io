Since owning the R32, I knew there were a few things that needed doing. The handbrake no longer held the car and the rear brakes barely worked. The handling when pushing the car hard didnâ€™t fill me with confidence. 

I decided that I was going to strip most of the suspension components off the car and replace each rubber bushing with either OEM or polyurethane bushings where needed. The car is old now, so some parts are probably not available, or some parts only come with bushes pressed in for example. 

My end goal was to make the car handle nicer. I wanted to invest in some high-flow manifolds and sports cats and then get the car remapped. I didn't want to go over the top with the performance modifications and I had no intention of going down the forced induction route either.

Overall, I wanted the car to be a real good example of how the car should have come out of the factory.
