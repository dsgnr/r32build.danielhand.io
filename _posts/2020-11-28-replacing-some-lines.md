Had a good run today. Managed to replace both front hard brake lines and the rear passenger brake line which runs to the ABS pump. 

Replacing the front drivers hard line to the ABS pump was a pain. The drivers side pipe intertwine around various other lines, like the brake servo and air con pipes. It took a lot of effort to feed the pipe. 

Front and rear passenger side lines went on in about 10 minutes.

However, the drivers rear line runs down the passenger side, then over the fuel tank. So I'll need to remove the heat shield and lower the tank down as much as I can. The prop shaft is still in place, so I'm not 100% sure how much room I'll be able to gain. But, I can see the clips above the tank for the brake lines, so I should be able to reach in there if I have a few inches of room. I've ordered some new bolts for the fuel tank as they're not looking their best. Will have to tackle that one next weekend.

Before I put the manifold back together, I'm going to give the engine bay a really good clean. Its pretty dirty! The same applies for the wheel arches.
