After a few months of enjoying the car, something I missed from my old MK5 R32 was cruise control and comfort blinkers. I picked up the retrofit kits from TPS and went ahead and whilst the steering wheel was off the car, I took the opportunity to use a leather restoration kit from Leather Repair Company which was a great kit! Turned out really nice I think, though I don't think I'd ever get it to look like a brand new wheel, it's definitely a huge improvement over what it was before.
