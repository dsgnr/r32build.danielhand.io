post_description: Replacing the aux belt and tensioner 
author: dan_hand

When turning at low speeds (like when parking) there was an annoying squeal coming from the belt. I figured it was time to replace the tensioner. Since the belt had probably never been replaced, I went ahead and replaced the belt whilst I was there.

Unfortunately, this didn't fix the issue (yay!), so now I'm thinking its the alternator clutch pulley thats seized. Will need to do some further investigation on this.
