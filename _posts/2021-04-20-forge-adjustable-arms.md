Next up, the Forge adjustable rear arms arrived, and I didn't fancy doing these myself this time after the pain of doing everything else on axle stands. I took the car to a reputable VW specialists in Littlehampton, who were great and loved the car.

The camber was way too much on the rear, and it couldn't be properly aligned as there wasn't enough movement.
