The car went in for its MOT today! This was the first time driving the car further than my driveway, and the front alignment was so far out, I had to turn the ESP off so the ABS didn't kick in on the fronts. On the drive, I was listening out for unexpected noises and it all seemed to be fine! I really do rate the B14's. I thought the ride would be significantly harder than before, especially since I have all new bushes and some were also polyurethane. The firmness is more or less the same as stock and isn't crashy at all. It did put a smile on my face.

The Lucifer system all the way through is really nice. It's pretty loud when you floor it, but standard driving round town it's pretty sedate with some more hints of the R32 burble. 

The MOT expired in January, and had been off the road for the last 7ish months - it did get the Covid MOT extension, which was pretty wasted on me since the car was off the road anyway! Of course, the whole car is brand new and went through with flying colours. All the mechanics were under the car taking photos and asking me questions about the "journey".

The car was also treated to new Michelin PS4's all round and a wheel alignment.

Unfortunately only the front wheels could really be aligned. It looks like I really need to get some rear adjustable control arms since the rear camber is 3 degrees out, and the toe is a little out as well. I think the rear could come down a little lower so its more inline with the front.

Overall, I think the car sits nice, and it'll be even better when I get the height sorted all round. I definitely think I need some spacers on the rear, but I cant decide on whether to go for 20 or 25mm on the rear. 

Anyway, here's where we're at today! The car was treated to a Bilt Hamber Auto Foam, Valet Pro Citrus and Tar remover (to remove any Lanoguard overspray), Iron X Fallout Remover, and also a quick single stage with my DA and a green pad with Menzerna 3800.
