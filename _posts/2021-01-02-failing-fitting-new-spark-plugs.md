Went to fit some new spark plugs since I haven't replaced them since I purchased the car in November 2019. I've only driven 1000 miles in the car since I've owned it, so when it gets back on the road, everything will be nice and fresh!

However, the gasket in cylinder 2 has completely gone. Unfortunately I'd only recently replaced the intake manifold gaskets. Guess they're going in the bin before the cars even driven...

Placed an order at TPS for the following:

- Rocker cover gasket
- Coil pack/spark plug cylinder gaskets
- Rocker cover bolts and sleeves etc (must be gold plated since they're ridiculously expensive)
- Intake manifold gasket (again) 
- Throttle body gasket (again)
- Various intake manifold bolts (again)

Plugs are NGK IZKR7Bs for reference.
