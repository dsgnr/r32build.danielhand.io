The clutch started to slip. Based on my paperwork, it was the original for the car, so it had lasted a good time! I was planning on getting the car in for chains next year, so I bought it forward so I wasn't doubling up on the costs. The car had all new fluids throughout (gearbox, diff, haldex with filter) whilst it was in. Parts replaced were water pump, chains, guides and sprockets and a new clutch and flywheel. My alternator pulley was also making a racket, so I had this swapped out whilst it was in for the work. No pictures of that work being done unfortunately.
