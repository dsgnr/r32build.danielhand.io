Waiting for my powder coating to come back, I proceeded to start with the exhaust manifolds. In order to do this, the intake manifold must be removed. This took a while to do as it is quite fiddly. 

I was going to replace the exhaust manifolds and cats with a Lucifer high flow system. Luckily, I managed to pick up some second hand manifolds and placed my order for some sports cats.

This was a pain. The access to the nuts on the bottom of the manifolds were non-existent and took me a good amount of time to get these out

Parts purchased from TPS:

Exhaust manifold gaskets
Intake manifold gasket
Throttle body gasket 
New breather hose to replace the one I broke
New manifolds studs and nuts
Various bolts to replace the old ones in the engine bay

Currently waiting for the sports cat to arrive
