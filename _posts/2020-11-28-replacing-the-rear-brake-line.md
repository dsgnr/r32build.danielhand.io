Because all of the brake lines from the ABS pump to the callipers broke when disconnecting them, I had to go and replace them all.

Last but not least, was the rear drivers side brake line. This was a pain since the brake line runs down the passenger side, over the fuel tank and then to its rightful place.

Lowering the fuel tank wasn't as bad as I was expecting.

New parts ordered from TPS:
- Fuel tank straps
- Fuel tank bolts
- Heat shield nuts and washers
- Fuel filter
- New clip washers for the heat shield
- New rubber spacers for the brake line
