post_description: No brakes!

The car is now off the axle stands, but on the first attempt at moving the car off the drive, I noticed there was no brake pedal. The rear pads were biting a small amount, but the front callipers weren't compressing at all.

Upon investigation of pipework, just to make sure I wasn't leaking etc, I noticed there was a split at the check valve on the vacuum pipe running from the brake servo to the intake manifold.

Replacing this, didn't fix the issue (I thought it would have at least an improvement), so the car was raised back up on the axle stands, and even more brake fluid was purchased. At first, I thought there was an issue with either the callipers or the master cylinder. However, after doing the VCDS output tests, then another few rounds of the ABS bleed procedure, the front callipers were finally biting. Only after 16 litres of brake fluid purging...
