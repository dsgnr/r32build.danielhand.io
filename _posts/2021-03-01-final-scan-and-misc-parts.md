Now I actually have brakes, the car is ready! Last final things I did were fit a new coolant bottle to replace the old one, and fitted the new battery cover trim that I purchased at the start of this project.

I will be giving the car a full decontamination wash to remove many months of grime before booking the car in for an MOT which is now due.

I also ordered some electrical terminal removal tools, but they were very poor and wouldn't work with the VW system, so I've purchased some proper ones and just waiting for those so I can fit the comfort turn signal relay
