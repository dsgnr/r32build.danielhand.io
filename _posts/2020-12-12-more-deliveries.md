More parts arrived this week.

- H&R front and rear anti-roll bars
- Powerflex front and rear wishbone bushes
- Powerflex steering rack bush
- Front and rear dogbone bush
- Rear control arm inner bushes
- Pipercross panel filter
- Lucifer sports-cats

I am still waiting for the Bilstein B14 shocks to arrive, so I am kind of in limbo until I get those. I have placed the final order from TPS for the rest of the bits I need to finish the front of the car, so in the meantime I can fit the Lucifer manifolds and start pressing in the new bearings and hubs into the rear arms. The rear diff still needs to be raised back to the car, but the weather is holding me back from completing that
